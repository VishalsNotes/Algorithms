1.Start
2.Declare the array,size,element to be placed and position
    i.e. LOC,element,i,A

3.Keep shifting the elements of the array to its next position by using loops
    while(i>=LOC)
    {
        Set A[i+1]=A[i];
        Set i=i-1;
    }
    [end the while loop]
4.Set A[LOC]=element;
5.N=N+1 (N is the total number of elements in the list)
6.Stop
